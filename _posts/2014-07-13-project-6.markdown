description: This research will explore the U.S. and global pharmaceutical and biotechnology market. It will reference the development process of Novazyme's HP-GAA orphan drug and Pfizer's Trovan drug. Referencing the development of these drugs will reveal methods to pass FDA approval requirements for regular drugs and orphan drugs and how to bring a drug to market via the FDA or the FDA's fast track approval. This research will also shine a light on proper manufacturing strategies, funding strategies, drug testing strategies, and mergers and acquisition strategies.
